Added Features:
  - You can now see what other places people liked who like a specific restaurant
  - Displays in another popup where the most liked among the people who liked the same store is displayed at the top
  - Added sign-in error message
  - A few other quality of life improvements

Issue to look out for:
  - The API used may not always respond and so an error will be displayed in the console
      - Restarting the server will fix the issue usually (just do it until it works without error)
